# SMM4H-HeaRD @ ACL-2026 Shared Task 2: Detection of Insomnia in Clinical Notes

## Corpus

This shared task utilizes a corpus of clinical notes derived from the MIMIC-III Database. The clinical notes have been augmented with additional structured patient information, specifically sex, age, and the medications prescribed during their hospital stay.

Participants are required to complete necessary training and sign a data usage agreement to access the [MIMIC-III Clinical Database (v1.4)](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/). After gaining access and downloading the files, participants must run the [`text_mimic_notes.py`](text_mimic_notes.py) script to retrieve clinical notes and associated patient information using the provided note IDs. This process builds the corpus utilized in this shared task, as detailed in the instructions provided below.

### MIMIC-III Notes Processing

The `text_mimic_notes.py` Python script is designed to retrieve clinical notes and patient information from the MIMIC-III clinical database. The script takes a text file containing note IDs, and merges it with the content of the notes from MIMIC-III, including additional demographic and prescription information.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas library
- datetime module

#### Usage

The script requires three command-line arguments:
- `--note_ids_path`: The file path to the text file containing the note IDs.
- `--mimic_path`: The directory path containing the MIMIC-III v1.4 CSV files (`NOTEEVENTS.csv.gz`, `PRESCRIPTIONS.csv.gz` and `PATIENTS.csv.gz`).
- `--output_path`: The file path where the processed corpus CSV will be saved. This output CSV file will have two columns: the note IDs and the textual data retrieved from MIMIC-III.

#### Command Syntax

The script is executed from the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
python text_mimic_notes.py --note_ids_path [path_to_note_ids_txt] --mimic_path [path_to_mimic_csv_directory] --output_path [path_to_output_csv]
```

#### Example Command

Here is an example command that illustrates how to run the script using specific paths for each required input:

```bash
python text_mimic_notes.py --note_ids_path ./training/sample_note_ids.txt  --mimic_path ./mimic-iii/1.4 --output_path ./training/sample_corpus.csv
```

This command will process the note IDs from `./training/sample_note_ids.txt`, merge them with the data found in `./mimic-iii/1.4`, and output the resulting corpus to `./training/sample_corpus.csv`.
